# House Voting Web App in Flask
Each year, my mates and I go on an annual holiday. This year's edition is at Phillip Island.
There's roughly 20 of us who attend these trips, meaning that we split up into a few different houses within the area.

This is a web-app designed for this trip. 
It allows everyone to sign up, log in and cast 2 votes for people who they want to be in a house with.
Once everyone has voted, the votes are run through a house-sorting algorithm of sorts, of my creation.

The application itself is built using Python and Flask, with the front-end being displayed using HTML and Bootstrap.
For the local version, I store all of the data in a SQLite database.

For the deployed version, I deployed it using Heroku and updated the SQLite database to a Postgres database.
The link to the current deployed version is here: https://mut-house-voting-cb1eb2f287b9.herokuapp.com/

Edit: Removed the app as I was paying $10p/m, oops.
